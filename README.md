# Titanic Survivers Prediction Using Machine Learning
One of the most infamous shipwrecks throughout history includes the sinking of the Titanic.
## Background
During its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, the otherwise unsinkable RMS Titanic was wrecked when it collided with an iceberg. Unfortunately, not enough lifeboats were available to accommodate the whole crew and passengers, which resulted in 1502 deaths.

Surviving may have involved a certain amount of luck, but it seems some groups were more likely to survive than others.

Through this research, I have attempted to build a predictive model that could answer the question: "what sorts of people are likely to survive?" using passenger information (i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).
